We live in an era where buzzwords such as “artificial intelligence” or “deep learning” are gaining increasing interest from the general 
audience, on top of the academic community. There is no doubt that we are part of the fourth industrial revolution, and tech companies are 
investing more and more funds in AI research.  

Same applies to academia, either by developing novel learning algorithms or by applying existing methods to answer research questions in 
a better and more comprehensive way. The past year I attended several civil/urban engineering conferences and was excited to see a 
significant shift to applied machine learning research (much needed in my opinion). Nevertheless, civil engineering is often considered as 
the “laggard” engineering domain when it comes to innovation and disruptive technologies. 

In this post I scraped the [ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering](https://ascelibrary.org/journal/jccee5) website to see how AI methods have penetrated civil engineering 
research the past decade. I searched how words such as “machine learning”, “artificial intelligence”, “deep learning”, “random forests” 
were used in paper titles and here is what I found.

I split the search into “machine learning” and “deep learning”, with the latter including keywords such as “convolutional”, 
“reinforcement learning”, “deep learning”. Although we see a positive trend in machine learning related research over the timeline, it 
appears that 2018 was a pivoting year for AI and civil engineering, with the volume of papers growing more than 3x compared to the previous 
year. Interestingly, it is only until 2018 when any deep learning research is published. 

This is definitely a promising outlook for the future of AI and civil engineering. There is no shortage of applications where AI can help 
monitor, understand and improve civil/urban engineering systems, including urban infrastructure management, traffic optimization or BIM 
improvement to name a few.
