I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Urban Systems & Informatics at New York University, and a researcher in the <a href="http://www.urbanintelligencelab.org/">Urban Intelligence Lab</a> at NYU Center for Urban Science + Progress. 

Passionate about urban science and informatics research, I strive to address the environmental, economic, and social issues of cities. My recent projects leverage machine learning algorithms and big data to (a) identify patterns in urban energy consumption, (b) develop robust and fair city energy performance metrics, and (c) assess the effectiveness of existing carbon-reduction policy frameworks, among others. A detailed list of my completed research projects are on my <a href="https://scholar.google.ae/citations?user=ZbefF6QAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> profile.

Prior to joining NYU, I received my M.S. in Engineering Systems & Management from Masdar Institute in Abu Dhabi, UAE (in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology). 

My diverse experience of Europe, Middle East and the US, has inspired me to further study the complex socio-technical challenges cities worldwide face.
