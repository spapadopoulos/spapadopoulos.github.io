My detailed CV is available <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/dummy.pdf">here</a>.

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Urban Systems & Informatics at New York University. Also, I am a researcher in the <a href="http://www.urbanintelligencelab.org/">Urban Intelligence Lab</a> at NYU Center for Urban Science + Progress. 

I am passionate about urban science and informatics research, addressing the environmental, economic, and social issues of cities. My recent projects leverage machine learning algorithms and big data to (a) identify patterns in urban energy consumption, (b) develop robust and fair building energy performance metrics, and (c) assess the effectiveness of existing carbon-reduction policy frameworks, among others. A detailed list of my completed research projects are on my <a href="https://scholar.google.ae/citations?user=ZbefF6QAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> profile.

Prior to joining NYU, I received my M.S. in Engineering Systems & Management from Masdar Institute (in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology). My diverse experience from Europe, Middle East and the US, fascinates me to further study the complex socio-technical challenges each city faces.
